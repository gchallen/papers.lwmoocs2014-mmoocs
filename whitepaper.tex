Unfortunately, dividing lines are already being drawn
between faculty able to create MOOCs and those encouraged or even forced to
use them. In their well-publicized rejection of Harvard's popular EdX course
on social justice, philosophy faculty at San Jose State University raised
concerns over the ability of online content to integrate into their existing
courses:

\begin{quote}

When a university such as ours purchases a course from an outside vendor, the
faculty cannot control the design or content of the course; therefore we
cannot develop and teach content that fits with our overall curriculum and is
based on both our own highly developed and continuously renewed competence
and our direct experience of our students' needs and abilities.

\end{quote}

As computer scientists, we see this complaint as expressing not a fundamental
limitation of MOOCs, but a design flaw in how they are currently built:
\textbf{today's MOOCs are not modular}. Modularity has long been appreciated
when designing and implementing computer systems. Monolithic ``blobs'' of
code, usually produced by a single developer to quickly solve a particular
problem, are difficult to improve, test, and maintain, and are unlikely to be
used by anyone but their creator. All of today's major online education
providers, including Coursera, Udacity, and the edX platform, provide
monolithic MOOC content: entire courses that are packaged and offered as an
indivisible unit. This flaw limits their ability to partner with faculty at
other institutions, to generate large and diverse data sets, and to fully
address diverse student learning styles and objectives.

Since today's MOOCs suffer from a common software design problem, we are
applying a standard software engineering solution: modularization. Modular
MOOCs break content into small \textit{modules} all sharing a common
structure. Individual modules can be tested and improved in isolation and
their impact on the entire class determined. As the goals and expectations of
the class for which they were originally created change, and as the content
itself changes, it is more likely that the functionality provided by modules
will continue to remain relevant, while adding new modules keeps the course
current.

Most importantly, modularization encourages the interinstitution
collaboration that today's monolithic MOOCs struggle to achieve. Modules
allow faculty to retain full control over course content and structure, with
the ability to add, remove, alter and reorder modules in ways expressing
their understanding of their students' needs and abilities, all while
producing experimental data that benefits the original course. When faculty
provide more effective replacements for existing modules, everyone benefits.
And if one faculty member discovers an effective sequence of modules, all
participating faculty can decide whether to adjust their own courses to
incorporate this insight.

We are currently exploring the design and construction of \textit{modular
MOOCs (mMOOCs)}, which exploit modularity to provide the control traditional
faculty desire while providing the diverse and well-structure data sets
required to answer fundamental questions about teaching and learning. We are
beginning by augmenting \opsclass{}, an online operating systems
instructional environment. Built by Geoffrey Challen, it has made automated
version of the programming assignments developed by Margo Seltzer available
online. Once \opsclass{} is able to support the diverse student outcomes and
needs at our two institutions, the University at Buffalo and Harvard
University, we will recruit faculty from other institutions to foster vibrant
multi-institutional collaborations in education, just as we currently do in
research.
